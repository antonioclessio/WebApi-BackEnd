# A Backend with WebApi

## The code here is a fragment of a project that was created to a brazillian client, so this is the reason that some comments and code are in portuguese

## All the sensitive data and informations was removed from this sample

The idea of this sample, is a simple backend with three layers:

- WebAPI (exposing the application on an HTTP protocol)
- Entity (classes, models and entity tables)
- Business (application, business rules)

This structure can be improved using SOLID (interfaces, dependency inject and so on), and must be developed using at least DDD.
The business layer use entity framework with code first concept.

This code will not compile.
The idea here is to show my coding style.

If you have questions, feel free to send me a message.
